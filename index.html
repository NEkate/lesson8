    Recommender systems have become an essential tool for finding the needle in the haystack of the World Wide Web - the information or item one is searching for. Finding the desired item is a daunting task considering the amount of information that is present in the WWW and its databases, and almost every e-commerce application will provide the user with the help of a recommender system to suggest products or information that the user might want or need. Recommender systems are employed to recommend products in online stores, news articles in news subscription sites or financial services like retirement plans. There are different recommendation methods, each one with its advantages and disadvantages. In order to provide individualized recommendations to each user of such a system, personalization is of high importance. In order to be able to personalize the use of a system, users are often modeled by the recommender system. Generally, the user model represents the user's taste, and it is generated, learned, or extracted from the information available about the user. Again, there are several methods to create a user model, which are often characteristic for every recommendation technique. User models can be built on explicit and implicit data. While explicit data refers to the data directly provided by the user in the form of, e.g. a questionnaire, implicit data refers to data provided implicitly by e.g. the user behavior. Often user models are created using both types of information.
